We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

### Data Collection

We do **not** collect, store, or share any personal data from you.

If you choose to enable iCloud support, data is stored in your private **iCloud account** and sync'd between your personal devices.
Your data is not accessible to us, and we have no servers or systems that collect or process your personal information.

### Data Storage

- **Local Storage:** Data is securely stored on your device using CoreData.
- **Cloud Storage:** If you have iCloud enabled, your data is also stored in your private iCloud account through CloudKit. Only you, or individuals you share content with, can access this data.

### Data Sharing

The app provides optional features that allow you to share certain data with other users.
Sharing is initiated and managed by you, and only the data you choose to share will be accessible to others.
We do not have access to any of your shared data.

### Third-Party Services

This app does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data.
