### Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you! My name is Chad, I'm a mobile software developer living out in Madison, WI.

#### ☀️ By day
I solve problems at Epic (the healthcare software company), building apps to help doctors and nurses document their work efficiently and safely. I've worked there for over 10 years and have enjoyed every minute.

It's not just development - but travel, research, meeting with users, UI design, usability testing, performance and scalability testing, feature deployment, and go-live support.

#### 🌖 By night
I like to play video games, visit new places and tinker with the latest mobile development tools.
[Split.bee](/splitbee) is one of the projects I am working on now to learn new Apple technologies!
